# pcb-defect-detection

We're building an AI-based PCB defect detector using YOLO to spot tiny, complex faults like shorts and missing holesâ€”faster and more accurately than manual checks.
Key Features:
Real-time, automated detection
High accuracy for small defects
Handles multiple defect types
Result visualization and report download via Web and Mobile interfaces
It replaces slow, error-prone inspections with smart, efficient fault detection.
